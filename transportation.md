This page will discuss transportation for our first field trip to the [Autodesk Technology Center](https://www.autodesk.com/technology-centers/san-francisco) at [Pier 9](https://goo.gl/maps/wqvHYxgA9iTirKtp9) in San Francisco.

## Travel Groups

I **strongly** encourage you to form travel groups of 2 to 4 students. Your group should decide when and where to meet, and which Muni line to take downtown.

Use the [Form Travel Groups!](#) post on Piazza to form groups.

## Muni Passes

All undergraduate students receive a free SF Muni Pass as part of their tuition. More details pending.

## Muni Lines

There are a few options for getting from main campus to the [Autodesk Technology Center](https://www.autodesk.com/technology-centers/san-francisco) at [Pier 9](https://goo.gl/maps/wqvHYxgA9iTirKtp9)

You can use Google Maps to plan your route, and other apps are available that tell you the time of the next available bus. The end point is [Pier 9, San Francisco, CA 94111](https://goo.gl/maps/wqvHYxgA9iTirKtp9).

More details pending.
