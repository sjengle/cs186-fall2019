---

This page will discuss transportation for our first field trip on **October 7, 2019** to the [Autodesk Technology Center](https://www.autodesk.com/technology-centers/san-francisco) at [Pier 9](https://goo.gl/maps/wqvHYxgA9iTirKtp9) in San Francisco.

<div class="notification is-usf-gold">
  <p>If travel for the field trip will cause you to miss another class (or have to leave early), please reach out to the class instructor and make sure this will be an excused absence. We can send an email confirmation that it will be for a field trip if needed.</p>

  <p>If you are unable to get an excused absence and must arrive at the field trip late, please reach out to the instructor on Piazza to make arrangements.</p>

## Travel Groups

I **strongly** encourage you to form travel groups of 2 to 4 students. Your group should decide when and where to meet, and which Muni line to take downtown.

<i class="far fa-user-friends"></i> Use the [Search for Teammates!](https://piazza.com/class/jw1afd1q2je3ig?cid=5#) post on Piazza to form groups.

## Muni Lines

There are a few options for getting from main campus to the [Autodesk Technology Center](https://www.autodesk.com/technology-centers/san-francisco) at [Pier 9](https://goo.gl/maps/wqvHYxgA9iTirKtp9). You can use Google Maps to plan your route, and other apps are available that tell you the time of the next available bus. The end point is [Pier 9, San Francisco, CA 94111](https://goo.gl/maps/wqvHYxgA9iTirKtp9). Here are a couple of options:

- Take the [5 Fulton](https://www.sfmta.com/routes/5-fulton) or [5R Fulton (Rapid)](https://www.sfmta.com/routes/5r-fulton-rapid) from the [Fulton St & Shrader St](https://www.sfmta.com/stops/fulton-st-shrader-st-14234) stop inbound to downtown (or the transit center). Get off at the [Market St & 1st St](https://www.sfmta.com/stops/market-st-1st-st-15638) stop.

- Take the [31 Balboa](https://www.sfmta.com/routes/31-balboa) from the [Turk and Chabot Terrace](https://www.sfmta.com/stops/turk-st-chabot-ter-16715) stop inbound to downtown (or the ferry plaza). Get off at the [Spear St & Market St](https://www.sfmta.com/stops/spear-st-market-st-16475) stop.

- Take the [21 Hayes](https://www.sfmta.com/routes/21-hayes) from the [Fulton St & Shrader St](https://www.sfmta.com/stops/fulton-st-shrader-st-17499) stop inbound to downtown (or the ferry plaza). Get off at the [Spear St & Market St](https://www.sfmta.com/stops/spear-st-market-st-16475) stop.

Once off the bus, walk along Market Street to the [Ferry Building](https://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/) and then along the Embarcadero to Pier 9. This should take approximately 15 minutes.
