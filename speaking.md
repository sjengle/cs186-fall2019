{{ site.description }}

No more than 15 incoming undergraduate first-year CS majors may register for the course, with preference given to students from low-income or underrepresented backgrounds. Students funded via the [Community Engaged Scholars in Computer Science](https://scholars.cs.usfca.edu/) scholarship program are required to take this or an equivalent course. Many of these students have not yet taken a course in computing or programming.

While the course will no more than 15 registered students, individual classes may optionally include non-enrolled participants. See the "Speaker Options" below for details.

Aside from the class time, we can accommodate a wide range of options for guest speakers. Some of these options are detailed below.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Format" icon="far fa-presentation" %}

We are extremely flexible on both the format and content of guest speaker events, however we especially encourage content designed for a diverse set of beginner-level students at the very start of their degrees.

 Some format possibilities (all of which we have experience arranging) include:

  - A no-prep no-travel virtual ask-me-anything or Q&A session with questions submitted from students ahead of time.

  - A no-prep interview-style Q&A moderated by the instructor focused on your background and experiences in tech with following Q&A session.

  - A practice run of an upcoming talk for another event, or re-hash of a previously-given talk. The students' background might not match the intended audience, but we can ask them to look into specific topics ahead of time.

  - A traditional talk designed for a beginner-level audience with following Q&A session.

  - An in-person workshop where students break into small groups to work on beginner-level exercises (lab computers available in the room).

  - A panel of guest speakers with following Q&A session (especially recommended for alumni).

Events may be in-person or virtual. Both in-person and virtual events have the option of being recorded. Recordings can be distributed privately to students or publicly.

Virtual events will be conducted using the free [Zoom](https://usfca.zoom.us/) video conferencing software hosted on the instructor's laptop. Virtual events also have the option of live-streaming to other CS students or the public.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Audience" icon="far fa-users-class" %}

Attendance is mandatory for our (up to 15) registered students. Our classroom supports up to 30 students, so we can easily open up the event to other CS students as well.

We can also open the event up to all students in the College of Arts and Sciences, the entire University of San Francisco, or even to the general public. We need considerable notice to accommodate those requests, as we need to reserve an event space with larger capacity.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Timing" icon="far fa-calendar-alt" %}

We are able to arrange for events that range anywhere between **20 minutes to 90 minutes** in length. However, events must occur within the class time of **4:45pm to 6:20pm** on **Mondays** between **August 26th to December 2nd, 2019**.

We often host guest speakers and panels as a department (e.g. not tied to a specific class), so we may still be able to arrange an event if this timing does not work with your schedule.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Advertising" icon="far fa-bullhorn"%}

We are able to accommodate a range of advertising options, including (but not limited to) the following:

  - List the event anonymously as "Guest Speaker" on our [course schedule](schedule.html) and only post details on our private internal course website.

  - List the event publicly on our [course schedule](schedule.html).

  - Announce the event on our CS student mailing list.

  - Announce the event on our CS [Twitter](https://twitter.com/usfcs) account.

  - Post letter-sized color flyers outside of CS classrooms and lab spaces.

For large events open to the University or public, we also have the option of:

  - Post the event on the [University-wide calendar](https://www.usfca.edu/calendar).

  - Post letter-sized color flyers around campus.

We also have limited budget to design, print, and distribute larger event posters for campus-wide events. See this [speaker series](http://vgl.cs.usfca.edu/dvss/) for example event posters.

{% include anchor.html h="h2" text="Speaker Benefits" %}

Beyond the intangible benefits associated with this type of service, speakers will receive a formal thank you letter, free on-campus parking, and a small honorarium through [our grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1833718) to offset other local travel expenses. We may be able to also provide pizza for the audience if we partner with other student groups on campus (e.g. [Women in Tech](https://twitter.com/wit_usf), Diversineers, or our [ACM](https://usfcaacm.github.io/) student groups) and open the event up to other students within the CS department.
