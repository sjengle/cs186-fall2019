title: Guest Speakers
---

Want to share your expertise and experiences with an extremely diverse set of beginner-level students majoring in CS? Being a guest speaker for this course is a low-barrier way to become involved and give back to the community!

{% include anchor.html h="h3" text="Audience" icon="far fa-users-class" %}

Attendance is mandatory for our (up to 15) registered students.

The registered students are incoming first-year CS majors. The overwhelming majority of these students are from underrepresented backgrounds (race, ethnicity, gender, and economic status). Some students may not yet have prior experience in CS.

We can also invite up to another 15 non-registered CS students to participate.

{% include anchor.html h="h3" text="Format" icon="far fa-presentation" %}

We are extremely flexible on both the format and content of guest speaker events, however we especially encourage content designed for a diverse set of beginner-level students at the very start of their degrees.

<!-- Some format possibilities (all of which we have experience arranging) include:

  - A no-prep no-travel virtual ask-me-anything or Q&A session with questions submitted from students ahead of time.

  - A no-prep interview-style Q&A moderated by the instructor focused on your background and experiences in tech with following Q&A session.

  - A practice run of an upcoming talk for another event, or re-hash of a previously-given talk. The students' background might not match the intended audience, but we can ask them to look into specific topics ahead of time.

  - A traditional talk designed for a beginner-level audience with following Q&A session.

  - An in-person workshop where students break into small groups to work on beginner-level exercises (lab computers available in the room).

  - A panel of guest speakers with following Q&A session (especially recommended for alumni). -->

Events may be in-person or virtual. Both in-person and virtual events have the option of being recorded. Recordings can be distributed privately to students or publicly.

<!-- Virtual events will be conducted using the free [Zoom](https://usfca.zoom.us/) video conferencing software hosted on the instructor's laptop. Virtual events also have the option of live-streaming to other CS students or the public.

{% include anchor.html h="h3" text="Timing" icon="far fa-calendar-alt" %}

We are able to arrange for events that range anywhere between **20 minutes to 90 minutes** in length. However, events must occur within the class time of **4:45pm to 6:20pm** on **Mondays** between **August 26th to December 2nd, 2019**.

{% include anchor.html h="h3" text="Advertising" icon="far fa-bullhorn"%}

We are able to accommodate a range of advertising options.

For example, for events for registered students only, we can list the event anonymously as "Guest Speaker" our public [course schedule](schedule.html) and share additional details on our private site.

For events open to non-registered students, we can announce the event on our CS [Twitter](https://twitter.com/usfcs) account, print flyers, advertise on our CS student mailing list, and post the event on the [University-wide calendar](https://www.usfca.edu/calendar).

Beyond the intangible benefits associated with this type of service, speakers will receive a formal thank you letter. We can also provide free on-campus parking and a small honorarium through [our grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1833718) to offset other local travel expenses.
